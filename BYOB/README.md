{% hint style="info" %}
BYOB is an open-source post-exploitation framework for students, researchers and developers. It includes features such as:

* Command & control server with intuitive user-interface
* Custom payload generator for multiple platforms
* 12 post-exploitation modules

It is designed to allow students and developers to easily implement their own code and add cool new features _without_ having to write a C2 server or Remote Administration Tool from scratch.



This project has 2 main parts: the **original console-based application** (`/byob`) and the **web GUI** (`/web-gui`).
